Ever experienced a Thanksgiving where you went all afternoon starving yourself, attempting to avoid the distant relatives whose names you can't quite remember, and generally suffering with just the thought of the delicious feast ahead to tide you over? I'll bet you sat down to that meal feeling like Ghandi after his 21 day Hindu-Muslim Unity Fast. You're about to tear into the Mt. Saint Helen of turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy when you suddenly realize that silence has fallen over the table and hands are being held. Oh yeah, it's time to say grace. Then grace goes on. and on. and on. You're sure you'll starve if this doesn't end soon. You're so close and yet so far...

Sadly, this same phenomenon befalls many an unprepared mover. You move into your new place guns blazing. Ikea bed frames and dressers arrive, your favorite Michael Jordan poster is ready for it's new spot above the mantle, and the dining table you ordered online looks easy enough to put together. Then you realize you don't have any tools. All the excitement of getting your metaphorical house feast on quickly turns to tragedy. Ever tried driving a nail with a shoe?
