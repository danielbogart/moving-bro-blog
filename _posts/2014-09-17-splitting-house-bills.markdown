Just about everyone can think of an instance they were at a restaurant with a group of friends and it came time to split the bill. Fighting ensued that could have rivaled WWII trench warefare in intensity. There were the inevitable friends who "only ate an appetizer" or claimed not to have had any of the beer. Tempers rose. Tears ensued. Friendships were lost. Can you imagine having to endure this pain and heartbreak at the end of every month when it's time to split the utility bills and house expenses?

Then there are the minor things that you spotted your housemates on, like picking up that 30 rack of Coors Light, or covering your friend at that Mexican spot that only takes cash. The costs add up and can lead to some unnecessary tension in the house. Luckily with the continuing advancement of tools available across the information super-highway, we have a few stellar options to alleviate the stress of bill sharing.

Our favorite is [Splitwise](www.splitwise.com), an easy to use bill sharing web and mobile app. Here you'll create an account and group name for your house, and then invite your roomies by email. Once they've joined (or even if they haven't), you can use this to tabulate bills. Splitwise will split the bills evenly, or allow you to allocate exact costs per person. They also have a handy auto-balance feature so that if J-Skrillz owes you $20 for gas, but you owe Dom $20 for electricity, Splitwise will shuffle the debts so that J-Skrillz can pay the $20 directly to Dom and you're all square. That said, they provide all the details so you can see exactly where the costs are coming from.

[Splitwise](www.splitwise.com) is key for serenity in your home life, and making sure everyone is pitching evenly on the beer fund. But it's also handy when splitting the cost of your [moving checklist](www.movingbro.com) if you use our "Add to Amazon Cart" feature. It'll allow you to have one or two housemates buy all the checklist items you need for the pad, then throw the bill up on [Splitwise](www.splitwise.com) so that everyone contributes evenly. Boom, knowledge dropped.
