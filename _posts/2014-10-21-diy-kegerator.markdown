A kegerator has an air of maturity and sophistication that bodes well for any young (or old) adult. It says, I don't buy kegs of Natty Light with the intention of finishing the whole thing in one night. I buy Double IPAs and Triple Bocks and beers with names you've never heard of because I'm going to savor them, and the kegerator, a true modern marvel, allows me to do so. 

Unfortunately, a brand new kegerator can set you back upwards of $1,000. Fortunately, we've found a do it yourself recipe that will have you pretentiously pouring in no time, for a lot less. If you use a cheap fridge from Craigslist or Ebay, this thing will set you back around $400. That's probably about the cost a couples kegs of Ballast Point or Fat Tire will set you back anyways.
