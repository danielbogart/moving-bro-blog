Life is composed of a series of critical decisions interspersed throughout otherwise less memorable life circumstances. Those vital decisions might include which best bros you make in high school, where you choose to go to college, what you study, who you marry, and the oft overlooked: which laundry detergent you use. That's right, here you were dumping shovel fulls of cat litter-like laundry detergent into your triple oversized dirty loads thinking it was no big deal. Think again.

Laundry detergent has radically evolved since the early Babylonian bros used fats boiled with ashes to make the first soap detergent around 2,800 B.C. Let's hope you've at least stepped up your game beyond that King Nebuchadnezzar. What we have at our disposal today is a veritable arsenal of laundry detergents for every color of clothing, stain level, and bizarre scent imaginable. On Amazon alone there are over 4,000 options for sale. For comparison's sake, we've compartmentalized detergents on the market into three categories: powders, liquids, and pods.

Powdered detergent is widely used, but the pitfalls are clear. If powdered detergent isn't fully dissolved by the water in your laundry machine, you're left with the conspicuous looking white "mystery stains" all over your clothes. Embarrassing is an understatement. These white stains can happen due to the consistency of the powder as well as how ridiculously full you jam packed your load. Powders also contain more chemicals, and can occasionally cause damage to septic systems. No bueno.

Generally speaking, liquids are the next best option in our research and testing. The detergent is already pre-dissolved, so you almost never get the stain factor. It's easy to measure and pour out, and just about everyone has used liquid detergent at some point. That brings us to pods, the new kids on the block. These guys claim to eliminate the spill factor from liquid and powder detergents, as well as removing the overwhelming process of measuring out your detergent for each load. In our experience, just the lack of nasty liquid residue that is inevitable when using a liquid detergent made using the pods a no-brainer.

So which pods are best? We found that [Tide Pods](http://www.amazon.com/Tide-Laundry-Detergent-Spring-Meadow/dp/B004YHKVCM/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1411229392&sr=1-2&keywords=laundry+detergent) 77 Count option combined the best value with cleaning efficiency and portability. With these guys you can simply grab a few pods and walk down to the laundry room or washing machine rather than muscling a one gallon drum of budget liquid detergent down four flights of stairs for each load. We selected our favorite detergent from each category, the price breakdown is as follows:

Although the pods are slightly more expensive than liquid and powder, the convenience combined with elminating messes and questionable white stains made it a clear winner. If you pick up laundry detergent from our [moving checklist](http://www.movingbro.com), you'll get these bad boys.
