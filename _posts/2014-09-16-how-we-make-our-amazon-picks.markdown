Think about the last time you made a major move. Have that nightmare thoroughly conjoured up in your imagination? Now remember how each time you realized you needed something for the house you had to drive over to the right store? Furniture might have taken you on an exhausting journey to the nearest Ikea. Need bathroom stuff? Maybe you were forced way out of your comfort zone and into Bed, Bath & Beyond. You undoubtedly braved the crowded warehouse that is Costco a few times as well.

Now all that stuff is available on Amazon.com. The major issue is that it takes hours to hunt it all down, scour the reviews, and find the affordable options. Fortunately, we've done that for you. Our team has methodically investigated the 40+ different laundry detergents you can buy, pondered the merits of single ply versus quilted toilet paper, and stayed up nights weighing the pros and cons of different hand towels.

The result is a set of recommended Amazon picks that you can depend on. All of our picks have at least a four star average rating on Amazon. We understand you have a budget and always pick the solution that combines quality with affordability. Ultimately, you have the last say, and even after you have added the items from your [movingbro.com](http://www.movingbro.com) [moving checklist](http://www.movingbro.com) to Amazon, you'll have the ability to look over all the items, prices, and reviews.
