When my current residence was instantiated and my friends and I all combined forces to move into the brohouse to end all brohouses, we each brought some baggage. Some literally brought bags. Garbage bags. That was all well and good - just one more thing we didn't need to buy on the faithful third Costco trip that week. Right?

Wrong. Those garbage bags were the most infuriating, traitorous, conniving garbage bags one could possibly imagine. All-purpose kitchen trash bags? More like Benedict Arnold stab-you-in-the-back bags. One moment you're happily tossing the unrecognizable remainder of a two week old California burrito in the trash, and the next you're unknowingly dragging the contents of your entire kitchen garbage can across the house. 

Let's break this down into the science of how these bags can be so destructive. Mistake numero uno: these bags have only a 50 gallon capacity. Sure, that's more gallons than you consume of Muscle Milk in a year, which says a lot, but this is trash we're talking about. The bags seem like they fit in the can initially, but after a few items have been discarded, the bags quickly sink into the trash can and no longer provide the necessary coverage.

Problem b: they are weak. These bastards stretch and tear easily. Tossed out a broken shot glass? Have fun collecting trash off the ground because now your trash bag looks like Freddy Krueger tried to pick it up.

Lastly, and most terribly, mistake 3: no ties on these guys. That's right, there is no way to tie up the top of the bags save for stretching out the corners and attempting some boy scout knot you don't actually know. This mistake was painfully obvious as soon as we tried to take out the garbage a day or two too late. Garbage is a little overfull? Well now garbage is a little all over your house.

Fortunately we've saved you this tremendous pain and frustration by picking the most stellar, trustworthy, and faithful garbage bags possibly for the good 'ol Moving Bro [moving checklist](http://www.movingbro.com).  Add the [Glad Tall Kitchen Drawstring bags](http://www.amazon.com/Glad-Kitchen-Drawstring-Trash-Gallon/dp/B00ASBOP9S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412873006&sr=8-1&keywords=B00ASBOP9S) to your checklist and you'll have 90 gallons of Ronnie Coleman strength tieable garbage bags in your brohouse arsenal.
