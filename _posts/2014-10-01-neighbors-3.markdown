Now time for the riveting final chapter of our series on not pissing off your neighbors. At this point you've read our last two articles, not pissing off your new neighbors [P. I]({% post_url 2014-09-27-neighbors %}) and [Pt. II]({% post_url 2014-09-30-neighbors-2 %}), and have it all nailed. Your neighbors think of you as a bro version of Martha Stewart. You're a saint. Even that tiny angry mop with teeth that your old neighbor calls a dog likes you.

But there's still one neighbor that just won't come around. He's the old man who seems to be always watching your house with a scowl. You think he's probably hiding a shotgun just out of reach when you see him staring at you with his icy gaze - and he probably is.

Since there aren't any guns on the Moving Bro [moving checklist](http://www.movingbro.com), you'll have to break out the metaphorical big guns. Let's face the facts, you'll probably never get along with this guy, all you can do is gather some ammo of your own. We recommend you attempt to make your interactions with the curmudgeon as amicable as possible, but when all else fails, have an ace up your sleeve. Scour the map on [Megan's Law](http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov/) and do a background check on [Instant Checkmate](http://www.instantcheckmate.com/) to uncover any dirt he might be hiding. If you find anything conspicuous, keep an extra watchful eye on this dude, and be certain not to piss him off. No haunted past? Then just keep your distance and there probably isn't much to worry about.
