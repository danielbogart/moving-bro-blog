Since your life is not Zac Efron's in "Neighbors", chances are cops won't be taking your side when the neighbors call in a noise complaint for blasting Biggie at 2 AM on Friday night. That said, there are a few precautionary steps you can take to turn those new neighbors into powerful allies rather than cantankerous grown-ups out to get you. Follow these three steps to get your relationship with the new neighbros started on the right foot:

**Step 1: Bake cookies**
<br>
That's right. Bake cookies. No one is too old or too manly to bake cookies. Bake that shit, bring it over to your neighbors to introduce yourself, and win their hearts faster than Lance won his last Tour de France. Cookies are the performance enhancing drugs of friendship.

**Step 2: Give the neighbors your digits**
<br>
No, not because you're hitting on your neighbors. Give them your contact info in case they need to reach you because you're being too loud, water got left on, house is on fire, etc. If they can call you *instead* of the cops, it's going to save anyone a lot of heartache.

**Step 3: Invite the neighbors over**
<br>
That's right, get 'em involved. As hard as it is to believe, the neighbors were once your age too. Sure, back then pet rocks were in style and Michael Jackson was still black, but having fun is timeless. Who knows, you might even be able to bring out a glimpse of the wild side. So next time it's Taco Tuesday, get them over for a few margs. Worst case, they say no and thank you for invite. Best case, your neighbors are closet ragers and you become bros for life.
