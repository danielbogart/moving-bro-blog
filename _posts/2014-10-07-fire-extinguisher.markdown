You do, that's who. Working smoke detectors should come first, so be sure to get a few that are actually turned on and fully functional. If you're going to hot box your new pad, at least remember to plug the detector back in afterwards, Cheech. There were over 325,000 house fires in 2012 alone, doing nearly $6 billion in property damage. A $10 smoke detector and $30 fire extinguisher can go a long way in helping prevent your place from becoming a casualty.

That's why we've added the [Kidde Multi Purpose Fire Extinguisher](http://www.amazon.com/Kidde-FA110-Purpose-Extinguisher-1A10BC/dp/B00002ND64) to the Moving Bro [moving checklist](http://www.movingbro.com) under the Miscellaneous category. We want to be sure no bro gets burned. You're no Gordon Ramsay, and kitchen fires can happen. You come home at 2 AM, pop a pizza in the oven, and before you know it it's 6 AM and you wake up in a haze of smoke from your incinerated drunk munchies.

That's when you can pull out that fire extinguisher you so cleverly purchased and mow down the flames like a firefighting version of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sure, you lost a pizza in the battle, but you won the war and your house is still standing. Be smart, and get protection. Keep in mind your friends won't thank you for the brain damage incurred by spraying them down with the fire extinguisher, so maybe keep your aim true.
