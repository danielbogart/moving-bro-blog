There is absolutely no reason your house shouldn't have paper towels. It is said that the only person to ever go without them for an extended period was Jesus, who endured a torturous 40 days and 40 nights sans paper towels. Oh but you have shamwows? Chances are you'll use those glorified rags once, throw them in a corner and put off washing them, instead switching back to majestic, timeless paper towels for good. In terms of ease of use for cleaning up disastrous kitchen spills, paper towels just can't be beat. Not to mention you can tie a string to one and fly it like a kite, use it as a bullhorn, a mask, or even a Mother's Day gift. Don't believe me? See following:

Choosing the best paper towels from Amazon for our recommended pick on the Moving Bro [moving checklist](http://www.movingbro.com) took time, dedication, and introspection. There are just over 6,500 options in the "Paper Towels" section on Amazon.com. While this is great in the sense that you know you can have any type of paper towel your heart desires, it can be daunting, even overwhelming for the average consumer. We did our homework, and found a clear winner for you. As mentioned in previous posts, we only consider options with at least a four-star average rating. This narrowed down the selection to 338 options, which included well known brands such as [Brawny](http://www.amazon.com/Brawny-Giant-Paper-Towel-Pick-A-Size/dp/B00CRCKDMY/ref=sr_1_3?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1411485654&sr=1-3&keywords=paper+towels) and [Bounty](http://www.amazon.com/Bounty-Paper-Towels-15-Count-Package/dp/B0009HW0KC/ref=sr_1_6?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1411485654&sr=1-6&keywords=paper+towels).

Next, we needed an option that would provide enough paper towels to last a 1-4 person household without being a dump-truck sized 100 bajillion-roll mega-value pack - that's just overkill. What we were left with was [Brawny](http://www.amazon.com/Brawny-Giant-Paper-Towel-Pick-A-Size/dp/B00CRCKDMY/ref=sr_1_3?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1411485654&sr=1-3&keywords=paper+towels), [Bounty](http://www.amazon.com/Bounty-Paper-Towels-15-Count-Package/dp/B0009HW0KC/ref=sr_1_6?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1411485654&sr=1-6&keywords=paper+towels), and [Sparkle](http://www.amazon.com/Sparkle-Paper-Towels-Print-Large/dp/B00BLZ2312/ref=sr_1_2?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1411486687&sr=1-2&keywords=paper+towels) paper towels. Then we did a last check of their reviews to make sure there were no hidden stains to their reputation and did a price break down. 

Here's what we found:

*	[Brawny](http://www.amazon.com/Brawny-Giant-Paper-Towel-Pick-A-Size/dp/B00CRCKDMY/ref=sr_1_3?s=hpc&ie=UTF8&qid=1411485654&sr=1-3&keywords=paper+towels): $1.25/roll

Sparkle was the clear winner given it's stellar reviews and substantial savings. Nothing even came close, and we think you'll agree. Spilled some water? Not anymore. Paper towels.
