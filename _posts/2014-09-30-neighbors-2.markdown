As a continuation of our first post on [not pissing off your new neighbors]({% post_url 2014-09-27-neighbors %}), today we'll share with you a few things to avoid so that you can live in relative peace and harmony in the neighborhood. Here are a few things *not* to do now that you're attempting to act like a civil, responsible adult:

  * **TP Their Trees**
  <br>
  You're not in high school anymore, so grow up Count Chocula. I'm disappointed this even crossed your mind.
  * **Park Your Car in Their Spot** 
  <br>
  No one wants to come home after a long day at the office to some asshole in their parking spot. You're taking something of yours and sticking it in something that's clearly his. This is analagous to sleeping with his wife, and almost as infuriating.
  * **Leaving Your Yard in Disarray** 
  <br>
  Now that you're in the big leagues with a pad of your own, it's time to start taking care of it. Nothing says I'm young and don't have my shit together quite like having empty beer cans and red cups scattered across your front lawn. 
  * **Do Noisy Stuff at Ungodly Hours** 
  <br>
  This should be obvious, but it is without doubt the most common source of angry neighbors. If you're wondering whether it's too late to be bumping that sick new Dillon Francis track on your 5.1 sound system with a 15" sub, just ask yourself: "Would Grandma be asleep right now?". If the answer is yes, then just don't do it. Wear some headphones, go to a friends place, whatever - just be cognizant of your neighbors.
