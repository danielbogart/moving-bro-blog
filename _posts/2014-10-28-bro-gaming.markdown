There are few things better than a game of [Mario Kart Drunk Driving](http://www.buzzfeed.com/zachkornfeld/the-mario-kart-drinking-game) on the N64. It's multiplayer Mario Kart with an intoxicated twist. The rules are simple:

* Each player must finish a fresh beer before end of race
* Can't drink beer while pressing 'A'

This is only one of the many awesome adult adaptations of the old school classic N64 games we grew up with. Just about everyone has played Kart, Super Smash, and Goldeneye, and they work great for some pregame action. The problem tends to be that no one actually kept their old N64. If they did, chances are you're going to have to blow those old game cartridges harder than Paris Hilton pre-2003, and the joysticks will be more flaccid than...well, you get the picture.

Fortunately, there's an alternative. [Project N64](http://www.pj64-emu.com/) is a free N64 emulator for PC. You can download and install it in just a few minutes, and find hundreds of [free ROMs](http://coolrom.com/roms/n64/) (N64 games for PC) online. Then the only thing you need are some [N64 USB controllers](http://www.amazon.com/Retrolink-Nintendo-64-Classic-Enabled-Controller/dp/B008L3UUPS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1414517423&sr=8-1&keywords=n64+usb+controller), and an HDMI cable to hook your computer to your TV. Party like it's 1999.
