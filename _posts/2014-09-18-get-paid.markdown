Now of course you read our last blog post on [how to easily split house bills and expenses]({% post_url 2014-09-17-splitting-house-bills %}) and are happily paying for your friends at every opportunity, spending with more reckless abandon than [Waka Flocka Flame](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/17/waka-flocka-flame-personal-blunt-roller_n_5836638.html). But what happens when it's time to collect? Planning on hounding your housemates to walk to the ATM each day, hovering over while they tediously count out exact change, then doing it all over again the next time you need some skrill? Come on now [Count von Count](http://33.media.tumblr.com/568881b97ce0f2d3e3b371be866cc390/tumblr_n5qp44TRuU1ro8ysbo1_500.gif), you're better than that.

That's where [Venmo](https://venmo.com/) comes into play - it's a web and mobile app that allows you to send and receive payments free of charge. The infobahn never ceases to amaze. Venmo is most easily utilized as a smartphone app, available on Android and iOS. Once you've hooked up your bank account, you're free to make it rain. You can send cash in just a few seconds, and similarly request funds from a friend - perfect for when you need to settle up after using our [moving checklist](http://www.movingbro.com). Venmo ensures bank grade security, and as long as you hook up a bank account or debit card rather than a credit card, they claim it will always be free.

This in conjunction with [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com) is a combo whose greatness rivals Red Bull + Vodka. There's even an option on Splitwise to "Pay with Venmo", which takes you directly to Venmo, lets you send the exact amount that you owe, and then records the payment. Just remember, if you have received money on Venmo, you will need to cash out to see the money in your bank account. Money shows up in your bank account generally in a few days. So there you have it. In just a couple blog posts you've gone from novice house expense bean counter to pad bill-sharing CPA. Just don't cook the books Ken Lay, or your beer fund might not be the only thing in jeopardy.
